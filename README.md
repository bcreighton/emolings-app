# EMOLINGS
The modern age version of a feelings chart for Parents/Caregivers to create better conversations with children about the feelings and emotions they experience on a daily basis.

This repo is the front-end client, built in React.  You can see the app live at [https://emolings-app.vercel.app/](https://emolings-app.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

Feeling charts are a thing of the past; unfortuantely, they're limited as they're static and although their purpose and intent of feeling identification is decent it doesn't solve the root of the problem. CONVERSATION & COPING SKILLS!

Emolings is a modern age version of a feelings chart!!

Not only does Emolings provide emotion and feeling identification, both from the Parent/Caregiver and Child perspective; but Emolings also provides the next steps which are the most essential.
* Create open communication between Parent/Guardian and Child
* Provide suggestions to help Parent/Guardian guide their Child to identify and express their emotions and feelings
* Present proven coping mechanisms to acknowledge and move through their emotions and feelings in a possitive manner
